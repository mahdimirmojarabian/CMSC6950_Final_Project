    "In a case study, an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device was deployed on the field in an Italian city to measure the air quality over the passage of time. The output data is the responses of a gas multisensor device. The dataset can be downloaded from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 9357 rows of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a highly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data was recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year), representing the longest freely available recordings of on-field deployed air quality chemical sensor device responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Methanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer. Missing values are labeled with \"**-200**\".\n",
